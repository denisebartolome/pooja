Short Bio: "Pooja Mallipamula is a white-washed Indian chick who moved to NYC in pursuit of comedy. She has degree in Engineering and Journalism, neither of which she puts to actual use in the real world. She is a Business Analyst during the day and a Stand Up Comic at night. She is really a gay boy trapped in a woman's body. She is already prepared for her future husband to come out of the closet after having children together. She is still innocent enough to believe that voting in elections will actually make an impact in our status quo. She is also a social butterfly obsessed with fashion, chocolate and over analyzing everything. Most Importantly she is the Brunch Queen!" (Does this sound accurate?)
